Both original implementations rely on Python’s Timsort via sorted() so they share the same asymptotic cost: O(n log n) time and O(n) additional memory (because sorted returns a new list). The AI version is slightly more production-aware: it exposes reverse and wraps the call in exception handling so it doesn’t crash on missing keys, but its strategy of returning an empty list on error discards useful data and hides which records failed. The manual version is minimal and clear — good for small scripts or when inputs are guaranteed valid — but will raise KeyError on missing keys. A robust approach is to explicitly decide how to handle missing keys (supply a missing_value or raise a clear error), and optionally provide in_place sorting to avoid an extra list allocation when memory matters. For numeric sorts, choose a missing_value like float('inf') to move absent entries to the end; for strings, use "" or a sentinel. Also consider key_transform if you need case-insensitive string sorting. In short: use the simple version for trusted data and prototyping; use the robust version above for production where inputs are noisy, memory matters, or predictable behavior on missing keys is required.
