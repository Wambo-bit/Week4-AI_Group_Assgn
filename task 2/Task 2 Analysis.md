Results and Analysis Summary

In this task, Selenium WebDriver was used within Google Colab to automate testing of a login page. Two test cases were executed: one for a valid login (correct username and password) and another for an invalid login (wrong credentials). Both test cases passed successfully, as indicated by the terminal output showing .. [100%] 2 passed in 3.72s.

An HTML report (report.html) and a JSON file (results.json) were automatically generated. These reports summarized the test results, showing the names of the tests, their status (Passed), and the total execution time. This confirmed that the login form correctly handled authentication and validation processes.

The results verify that the system works as expected â€” accepting valid inputs and rejecting invalid ones. The AI-assisted Selenium framework enhanced test coverage by automatically synchronizing waits, detecting elements intelligently, and generating structured test results. This ensures faster, consistent, and more reliable testing compared to manual methods
