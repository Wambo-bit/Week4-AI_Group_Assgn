In this task, Selenium WebDriver was used in Google Colab to automate login testing on a sample website. Two cases were executed: a valid login using correct credentials and an invalid login using incorrect ones. The AI-powered test framework automatically detected elements, synchronized waits, and verified expected results without manual intervention. Both tests passed, confirming that the login form behaves correctly.

AI improves test coverage compared to manual testing by automatically generating additional edge cases, identifying potential UI inconsistencies, and accelerating test execution across browsers. It can also suggest new scenarios based on user behavior data, reducing human oversight errors. The automated process ensures consistent, repeatable validation, leading to higher reliability and faster feedback during software development.
